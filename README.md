a) The purpose of these programs is to use dictionaries and understand them in real coding. 
b) For Q1, the program just consists of the dictionaries (values, suits) of the 52 playing cards. For Q2, the input is the DNA sequence. 
c) For Q1, the program just consists of the dictionaries (values, suits) of the 52 playing cards. For Q2, the ouput is the encoded protein. 
d) For both programs, there are dictionaries. For Q2, there also includes optional arguments. 
e) My program could be improved with more efficiency. For instance, in Q1, it is very inefficient, because I wrote every element of the dictionary, when there could be a less time-consuming way to do it.
